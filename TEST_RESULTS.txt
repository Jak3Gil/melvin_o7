MELVIN O7: Pattern Hierarchies & Wave Propagation Test Results
================================================================

SIMPLE TESTS (Wire-like behavior):
----------------------------------
✓ cat -> cat (Sample 1)
✓ dog -> dog (Sample 2)  
✓ bat -> bat (Sample 3)
✓ rat -> rat (Sample 4)
✓ hat -> hat (Sample 5)

Result: 5/5 correct (100%) - Works immediately, 1-5 samples needed

COMPLEX TESTS (Brain-like behavior):
------------------------------------
✗ hello -> hat a (Sample 6)
✗ world -> wog a (Sample 7)
✗ hello -> hat a (Sample 8)
✗ world -> wogt (Sample 9)
✗ what is -> wogt ht (Sample 10)
✗ what is the -> wot rwot rw (Sample 11)
✗ what is the capital -> wot wotwotwotwotwot (Sample 12)
✗ what is the capital of -> wotwotwotwotwotwotwotw (Sample 13)
✗ what is the capital of france -> wotwotwotwotwotwotwotwotwotwo (Sample 14)
✗ the quick brown fox -> twotwotwotwotwotwot (Sample 18)
✗ jumps over the lazy dog -> juwotwotwotwotwotwotwot (Sample 19)

Result: 0/13 correct (0%) - Attempts but fails, 26+ samples and still failing

TRAINING SAMPLES NEEDED:
------------------------
Simple tasks: 1-5 samples (immediate success)
Complex tasks: 26+ samples (still failing)

PATTERN HIERARCHIES:
--------------------
✓ Forming hierarchies (depth 1, depth 2)
✓ Meaning accumulation happening
⚠ Some patterns show "inf" meaning (overflow issue)
✓ Pattern-to-pattern predictions working

WAVE PROPAGATION:
-----------------
✓ Multi-step working (518 steps vs 1 pass in standard NN)
✓ Path-aware propagation
✓ Pattern-guided flow
⚠ Error rate increases with complexity (0.450 → 0.732)

CONCLUSION:
-----------
- System works perfectly for simple tasks (wire-like)
- System attempts complex tasks but fails (needs improvement)
- Pattern hierarchies and wave propagation are active
- Complex sequences get stuck in loops ("wotwotwot...")
- More training or architectural improvements needed for complex tasks
