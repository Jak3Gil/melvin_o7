FIXES IMPLEMENTED (No Static Variables, No Breaking Changes)
=============================================================

1. MEANING OVERFLOW FIX
-----------------------
Problem: accumulated_meaning showed "inf" causing NaN in calculations

Solution: Added bounds checking and capping:
  - Cap chain_meaning at 100.0f, use log scale above that
  - Hard cap at 1000.0f for accumulated_meaning
  - Reset to 1.0f if NaN/Inf detected
  - Cap meaning_ratio at 100.0f to prevent division overflow
  - Cap pattern_meaning_boost at 200.0f

Location: Lines 1204-1212, 2481-2484, 2579-2586, 1350-1360

Result: ✅ Meaning values now bounded (max 1000.0), no more inf/nan


2. PATTERN-GUIDED OUTPUT SELECTION
----------------------------------
Problem: Complex code was disabled, only simple greedy edge following

Solution: Hybrid approach - pattern-guided + greedy fallback:
  - STEP 1: Check pattern predictions first (pattern-guided intelligence)
    * Patterns that match current output predict next nodes
    * Score = pattern.strength × pattern.activation × prediction_weight
    * Boost by pattern_confidence (2x if > 0.7)
    * Add node activation support
    * Suppress looping nodes
  
  - STEP 2: Greedy edge following (fallback when no pattern match)
    * Follow strongest edge from previous output
    * Add node activation support
    * Suppress looping nodes
  
  - STEP 3: Fallback to input sequence

Location: Lines 3575-3654 (replaced simple greedy with hybrid)

Result: ✅ System now uses pattern predictions when available, falls back to edges
        ✅ No breaking changes - still works for simple tasks


3. IMPROVED LOOP SUPPRESSION
-----------------------------
Problem: Loops detected too late, suppression not aggressive enough

Solution: Multi-level loop detection and suppression:
  - Detect 2-character repetition (earlier detection)
  - Detect 3-character repetition (existing)
  - Detect single character repetition 3+ times (new)
  - Apply loop_penalty in pattern selection (0.1 for immediate, 0.2 for near)
  - Apply loop_pressure system-wide suppression
  - Increase loop_pressure faster when loops detected (+0.2 per detection)

Location: Lines 4061-4105 (improved detection), 3575-3654 (suppression in selection)

Result: ✅ Earlier loop detection, more aggressive suppression
        ✅ Works in both pattern-guided and edge-based selection


TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
- No static variables used (all state in MelvinGraph structure)
- No breaking changes (existing simple tasks still work)
- Backward compatible (fallback mechanisms ensure system always has output)
- Self-regulating (caps prevent explosion, NaN checks prevent crashes)

TESTING
-------
✅ Compiles without errors
✅ Meaning values bounded (no inf/nan)
✅ Pattern-guided selection active
✅ Loop suppression improved
⚠ System still learning (separate issue, not related to these fixes)
