RELATIVE EDGE WEIGHTS (No Global Normalization)
================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
- Global normalization dilutes weights instantly
- More edges = lower weights for all (forced to sum to 1.0)
- Example: Node 'c' has 10 edges → each gets 0.1 weight (normalized)
- This prevents self-adjustment - edges can't grow independently

SOLUTION:
---------
Weight represents: "How STRONG is this edge relative to other edges FROM THIS SOURCE NODE?"

NOT: "What proportion of all edges globally does this represent?"

IMPLEMENTATION:
--------------

1. NO GLOBAL NORMALIZATION
   - Edges grow independently through usage and success
   - Weights can be any positive value (0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, etc.)
   - No forced sum to 1.0

2. RELATIVE COMPARISON (when selecting from a node)
   - Get max weight from source node: max_weight = max(all edges from node)
   - Compare relatively: relative_weight = edge.weight / max_weight
   - This makes weights relative to the node's context, not globally

3. EDGE GROWTH (self-adjusting)
   - Base growth: 0.1 × learning_rate × port_penalty
   - Usage boost: log(1 + use_count) / 10
   - Success boost: 1.0 + (success_rate × 2.0)
   - Growth: base × (1 + usage) × success
   - No normalization after growth - weights grow independently

4. SELECTION (relative to source node)
   - For each edge from source node:
     * relative_weight = edge.weight / max_weight_from_node
     * usage_boost = log(1 + use_count) / 5
     * success_boost = 1.0 + success_rate
     * score = relative_weight × (1 + usage) × success
   - Select edge with highest score
   - This compares edges RELATIVE to the source node, not globally

EXAMPLE:
--------
Node 'c' has edges:
  c→a: weight=5.0, use=100, success=0.9
  c→t: weight=2.0, use=50, success=0.8
  c→d: weight=0.5, use=10, success=0.3

Max weight from 'c' = 5.0

Relative comparison:
  c→a: relative=1.0, usage=0.92, success=1.9 → score=1.75
  c→t: relative=0.4, usage=0.78, success=1.8 → score=0.56
  c→d: relative=0.1, usage=0.40, success=1.3 → score=0.05

Select c→a (highest relative score)

KEY INSIGHT:
------------
- Weight = absolute strength (can grow unbounded)
- Selection = relative comparison (weight / max_from_node)
- No global normalization = edges grow independently
- Relative comparison = weights meaningful within node's context
- Self-adjustment = strong edges grow, weak edges stay weak or get pruned
