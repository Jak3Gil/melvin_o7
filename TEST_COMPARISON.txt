TEST RESULTS: BEFORE vs AFTER FIXES
====================================

BEFORE FIXES (Original System):
--------------------------------
Simple tests: 5/5 correct (100%)
  ✓ cat -> cat (Sample 1)
  ✓ dog -> dog (Sample 2)
  ✓ bat -> bat (Sample 3)
  ✓ rat -> rat (Sample 4)
  ✓ hat -> hat (Sample 5)

Complex tests: 0/13 correct (0%)
  ✗ All complex tests failed (loops, wrong outputs)

Issues:
  - Meaning showed "inf" (overflow)
  - Complex tests failed (expected)
  - Simple tests worked perfectly

AFTER FIXES (Current System):
------------------------------
Simple tests: 2/13 correct (15.4%) ⚠️ REGRESSION
  ✓ cat -> cat (Sample 1)
  ✗ dog -> dtc (Sample 2) - WRONG
  ✗ bat -> bgt (Sample 3) - WRONG
  ✗ rat -> rct (Sample 4) - WRONG
  ✓ hat -> hat (Sample 5)

Complex tests: 0/13 correct (0%) - No change
  ✗ All complex tests still fail

Improvements:
  ✓ Meaning overflow fixed (no more "inf")
  ✓ Pattern-guided selection active
  ✓ Loop suppression improved

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
The pattern-guided selection is INTERFERING with simple edge-based paths!

When patterns aren't well-learned yet, pattern predictions are WRONG,
but the system prioritizes them over correct edge-based paths.

Example: "dog" -> "dtc" instead of "dog"
  - Pattern might predict 'd' -> 't' (wrong)
  - Edge path 'd' -> 'o' -> 'g' (correct) is ignored
  - Pattern score beats edge score even when pattern is wrong

SOLUTION NEEDED:
----------------
Pattern-guided selection should only activate when:
  1. Patterns are CONFIDENT (pattern_confidence > threshold)
  2. Pattern predictions have HIGH strength
  3. Pattern matches are STRONG

Otherwise, fall back to edge-based selection (which worked for simple tests).
